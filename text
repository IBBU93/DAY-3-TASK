Differences between Document and Window Objects


Document Object:
                 The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the 
       document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.          

       Syntax:
              document.property_name;

 Properties of document:

              * activeElement: It returns the currently active elements in the document.
              * body: It returns the contents of the body element.
              * anchors: It returns all <a> elements that have a name attribute.
              * baseURI: It returns a string value that represents the base URI of the document.
              * cookie: It returns the cookie of the current document.     

Window Object: 

             The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or
        frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 

        Syntax:

              window.property_name;

 Properties of the window:

            * Closed: It holds a Boolean value that represents whether the window is closed or not.
            *  console: It returns a reference to the console object which provides access to the browserâ€™s     debugging console.
           *  defaultStatus: It is used to define the default message that will be displayed in the status bar when no activity is carried on by the browser.
           * controllers: It returns the XUL controller objects for the current Chrome window.
